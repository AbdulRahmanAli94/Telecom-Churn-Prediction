# Telecom-Churn-Prediction

### Problem Statement :
In the telecom industry, customers are able to choose from a pool of companies to cater their needs regarding communication and internet. Customers are very critical about the kind of services they receive and judge the enitre company based on a single experience! These communication services have become so recurrent and inseparable from the daily routine that a 30 minute maintenance break kicks in anxiety in the users highlighting our taken-for-granted attitude towards these services! Coupled with high customer acquisation costs, churn analysis becomes very pivotal! Churn rate is a metric that describes the number of customers that cancelled or did not renew their subscription with the company. Thus, higher the churn rate, more customers stop buying from your business, directly affecting the revenue! Hence, based on the insights gained from the churn analysis, companies can build strategies, target segments, improve the quality of the services being provided to improve the customer experience, thus cultivating trust with the customers. That is why building predictive models and creating reports of churn analysis becomes key that paves the way for growth!
